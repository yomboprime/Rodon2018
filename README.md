Open source wheeled robot.

This project will hold schematics, designs and code for a complete robot.

The main goal of the project is to create software for a wheeled robot suited for a diversity of common controller boards and hardware, i.e. Raspberry-like And Arduino/ESPxx boards.

The libre tools used are: Kicad for the electronics, Freecad and Blender for the 3D designs, Inkscape for 2D artwork, and your favourite manner of editing code.
